# Birth-Sky

This app shows the position of various heavenly bodies in the sky for any date. These are the seven naked-eye objects of the ancients: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

The app calculates the ecliptic longitude for each body as seen from the Earth. Then it plots the symbol for each one around a circle, as if it was the hand of a clock.
